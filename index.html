    <p>I have extensive experience in all areas of makeup artistry, ranging from beauty and editorial photography sessions, international runways, stage makeup, special effects and film/television through to bridal, formal and special osion makeup.</p>
    <p>With my experience, technical skill and creativity, I can create the right look for any project or osion, whether it be avant-garde fashion, period makeup or simple and understated makeup for a formal or wedding.</p>
    <p>I have a very positive and personable approach to all my work and I like to start by having a chat to every new client to find out what their personal style is, and to discuss the look that they are going for and the level of coverage that they are comfortable with. I love working with my clients to help bring out their best features and making them feel comfortable in their own skin.</p>
    <p>I work with two different types of makeup – traditional and airbrush – and will discuss the benefits of either option with you before we get started. All my pricing also includes the application of natural lashes to help complete your look.</p>
